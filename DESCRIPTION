Description: Implements a web-based graphics device for animated visualisations. 
  Modelled on the 'base' syntax, it extends the 'base' graphics functions to 
  support frame-by-frame animation and keyframes animation. 
  The target use cases are real-time animated visualisations, including agent-based 
  models, dynamical systems, and animated diagrams. 
  The generated visualisations can be deployed as GIF images / MP4 videos, as 
  'Shiny' apps (with interactivity) or as HTML documents through embedding into 
  R Markdown documents.
