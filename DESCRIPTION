Description: Implements a web-based graphics device for animated visualisations. 
  Powered by 'd3.js' and 'sketch', this package is modelled on the 'base' syntax, 
  and it extends the 'base' graphics functions to support frame-by-frame animation and 
  keyframes animation. The target use case is real-time animated visualisations, 
  including agent-based models, dynamical systems, and animated diagrams. 
  The generated visualisations can be deployed as GIFs / MP4 videos, as Shiny apps 
  (with interactivity) and as HTML documents through embedding into R Markdown documents.
